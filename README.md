# OpenFold-based Attention Visualization Demo

This is a lightweight extension of [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) that enables interactive visualization of attention mechanisms in protein structure prediction. It provides tools to render MSA row and Triangle attention scores as:

- Arc diagrams (sequence space)
- 3D PyMOL overlays (structure space)

---

## Key Features

- Compatible with OpenFold outputs (`.pdb`, attention text dumps)
- Support for layer- and head-specific visualizations
- Integrated residue highlighting
- Notebook-friendly and HPC-friendly workflow

---

## Installation

This repo assumes you have already installed [OpenFold and its dependencies](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html), or you are using CyberShuttle (see `cybershuttle.yml`)
You will also need:
- `PyMOL` (open-source version is sufficient)
- `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`
- `biopython` (for sequence parsing)

You can also install the full set of dendencies (including those for OpenFold) from our `cybershuttle.yml` file directly.
Beyond confirming the proper installation of OpenFold, you can test the specific dependendices for our repo by using:
```
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import csv
from pymol import cmd
from pymol.cgo import CYLINDER, SPHERE
```

## Interactive Demo: `viz_attention_demo.ipynb`

The notebook `viz_attention_demo.ipynb` demonstrates the full visualization pipeline using OpenFold.

It performs the following steps:

1. **Runs inference** using OpenFold with precomputed alignments
2. **Extracts top-k residue–residue attention scores** from each layer and head
3. **Saves these scores** to text files
4. **Visualizes attention**:
   - As **arc diagrams** (residue–residue attention on the sequence)
   - As **3D PyMOL overlays** (on the predicted structure)

We focus on two attention types:
- **MSA Row Attention**
- **Triangle Start Attention**

> The **thickness of the lines** (in both arc diagrams and 3D renderings) indicates the **strength of the attention score**.

### MSA Row Attention (Layer 47, Protein 6KWC)

- Shows pairwise attention between residues as inferred from multiple sequence alignments
- Visualized across all attention heads at a selected model layer

### Triangle Start Attention (Layer 47, Residue 18)

- Focuses on attention **from a single residue to others**, as part of triangle-based geometric reasoning
- The **selected residue is highlighted**:
  - In arc diagrams: using a **blue label**
  - In 3D visualizations: using a **sphere**
